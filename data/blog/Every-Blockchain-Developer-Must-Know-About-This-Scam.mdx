# üö® Warning for Freelance Blockchain Developers: Beware of a New Scam!  

Freelance developers, especially those working on blockchain and cryptocurrency projects, need to be vigilant about a new scam spreading across popular freelancing platforms. This scam involves a malicious Node.js script that scans a user‚Äôs storage and **exfiltrates sensitive data**, including browser wallet caches from extensions like **Phantom** and **MetaMask**.

I got this offers personally from Linkedin and Freelancer.com

## üõë **How the Scam Works**  

1. **Fake Job Offer:**  
   - The scam begins when a "client" contacts a developer on platforms like **LinkedIn**, **Upwork**, or **Fiverr** with a seemingly legitimate job offer.  
   
2. **Malicious Code Delivery:**  
   - After some discussions, the scammer provides a **JavaScript** or **Node.js** script for the developer to integrate into their project.  
   
3. **Hidden Malicious Payload:**  
   - The script contains hidden code that:  
     - **Scans Local Storage:** Looks for files or caches from browser wallet extensions like **Phantom** and **MetaMask**.  
     - **Extracts Sensitive Data:** Gathers private keys, wallet addresses, or other critical information.  
     - **Exfiltrates the Data:** Sends the stolen information to a remote server controlled by the scammer.

## üí• **The Impact**  

This scam is particularly dangerous because it targets developers who often work with **sensitive financial data**. By compromising a developer‚Äôs local environment, the scammer gains access to:  
- Cryptocurrency wallets.  
- Login credentials.  
- Other critical information stored on the system.  

For developers using browser wallet extensions like **Phantom** and **MetaMask**, the consequences can be severe. Losing access to these wallets often results in substantial financial losses.

## üõ°Ô∏è **How to Protect Yourself**  

Take these precautions to avoid falling victim to this scam:  

1. **Thoroughly Review Client Requests:**  
   - Scrutinize any code provided by clients, especially if it accesses or manipulates local storage.  
   - If you don‚Äôt fully understand the code, seek advice from peers or use online resources to verify its legitimacy.  

2. **Use Sandboxed Environments:**  
   - Run untrusted code in a **sandboxed environment** or a **virtual machine** to prevent it from accessing your main system‚Äôs storage.  

3. **Implement Security Best Practices:**  
   - Stay informed about the latest security threats targeting developers by following cybersecurity blogs, forums, and news outlets.

## üìä **What the Hacker Gets**  

Here‚Äôs an example of the kind of data a hacker can extract:  

![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r202f27qxrxmf8saxltc.png)  

In the folder Metamask for example in image above, you‚Äôll find a file named 000005.ldb or something similar. The exact number may vary, but it should be a low numerical value, such as 000004 or 000005. If the number is significantly higher, it is not the vault.

The hacker could decrypt that file if you‚Äôre not using a strong encryption password, potentially gaining access to your seed phrase‚Äîand as a result, you could lose your funds.

## üîí **Conclusion**  

**Do not run untrusted scripts on your main OS.** Always use a **virtual machine** or **Docker container** with limited permissions to test potentially malicious code.  

By staying vigilant and adopting secure practices, you can safeguard yourself and your projects from these scams. Stay safe! üöÄ

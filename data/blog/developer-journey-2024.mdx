My 2024 journey was a year full of technical achievements and new discoveries. After nearly 10 years of building products as a full-time engineer, in 2019, I discovered the world of blockchain, which has since become central to my life as a developer. I've built many products ranging from NFTs, staking platforms, to tracking platforms. In 2022, I began working for institutions to regulate stablecoins and build crypto custody solutions for institutional clients, with all my products constructed on Ethereum, Solana, and Tezos blockchains.

## The Big Learning of 2024: Domain-Driven Design

In 2024, my biggest learning was the application of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and creating full applications using C#. I couldn't imagine how easy the code became, even for non-coding users to understand through the use of ubiquitous language without delving into this concept.

## Building Beyond My Day Job

Meanwhile, in my full-time job, I was also building products part-time for clients, including multisig and escrow platforms. However, I realized that these products had a limited lifespan and revenue potential. I became almost obsessed with the idea of independence, aiming for a regular income to freely build my own ideas. I decided to quit all my part-time jobs to focus on this new path. The first product I built was a wallet where users could manage their assets and airdrop them across multiple blockchains. I received many great reviews:


## The Start of a New Path

The first product I created was a wallet application, built using Domain-Driven Design (DDD), which made it exceptionally developer-friendly and easy to use. Named x-wallet, this application enables users to manage their assets and airdrop tokens across multiple blockchains. I'm selling it as code on CodeCrayon. The positive feedback I received was overwhelming, and while I only managed to make six sales, it meant the world to me. It was the start of a new chapter in my career—a step toward realizing my dream of building products that truly serve the community.

Here are some of the reviews I received:

```
This was my first purchase.
When i need support regarding code, i can quickly communicate with him and get answers to my questions.
He is an honest, reliable and quality developer.
I will follow his future products!
```

```
The developer went back and forth with me for a dozen times and has incorporated BEP 20 tokens in the code. Sadly, the price of the token is hitched to coingecko and I want to be able to tackle that because crypto is supposed to be FREE and untethered to bosses of all kinds. But the developer is very very motivated and helpful and he listens and accommodates. I will come to add more comments - he also added my tokens image and had me list it on coin gecko. I am still understanding the product. THANK YOU so much

We added BEP20 tokens to this wallet and CUT it off from Coin Gecko bosses that were effing our freedom ... all code is laid out and Z. will also explain to you what everything is.

great to work with, easy code, and right to the point.

## Experimenting with Bulk Send Token Tools

Next, I decided to create a token bulk sender and token creator tool—not to sell the code, but to provide value directly to end users. This resulted in https://bulksendtokens.xyz, a platform I’m continuously improving. While it hasn’t generated revenue yet, I’m focusing on SEO and have already achieved a second-page ranking on Google.

## Looking Ahead

Throughout 2024, I continued to contribute to my full-time projects, building impactful blockchain-based products. However, X-Wallet and BulkSendTokens.xyz hold a special place in my heart as milestones that symbolize my journey toward independence and innovation.

As I move into 2025, my goal is to dedicate more time to building products that help the community while gradually transitioning into full-time independence. It’s an exciting journey, and I’m optimistic about what the future holds!

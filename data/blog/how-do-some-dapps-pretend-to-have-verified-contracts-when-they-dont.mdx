title: How do some dApps pretend to have verified contracts when they don't?

Recently, I started interacting with many DApps for DeFi, airdrops, or NFT exchanges. I noticed that most of the time, DApps are marked as **"contract verified"**, but in many cases, **only the proxy contract is verified‚Äînot the implementation**.

What does that actually mean? And is the contract truly verified in such cases?

Let‚Äôs break it down below.

let's start with some context:

The concept of **upgradable smart contracts** on Ethereum began emerging around 2017, with more formal and secure patterns being adopted by 2018.

Many decentralized applications (DApps) started using this pattern to prevent and mitigate vulnerabilities that could appear in the future.

## What Are Upgradable Smart Contracts?

**Upgradable smart contracts** follow a simple architecture:

- A **proxy contract** holds the data (storage)
- An **implementation contract** contains the business logic

When you deploy the proxy, it stays fixed. However, you can **upgrade** the implementation contract at any time‚Äî**without changing the proxy address** or notifying users. This makes upgrades seamless, but also **potentially dangerous**: a malicious owner could swap in harmful logic without anyone noticing.

As shown above, users always interact with the proxy. This proxy stores both the data and the reference to the implementation address.

The issue is: **most users only check if the proxy is verified**, and ignore the implementation. This gives a **false sense of security**, as the real logic could be unverified or even malicious.

## Real-World Examples

I checked several popular token tools. Most of them only verify the **proxy** but not the **implementation** contract.

### [BulkSender.app](https://bulksender.app)

The proxy contract is verified, but the implementation is **not**:

### [CryptoSender.com](https://cryptosender.com)

Same story: the proxy is verified, the implementation is **not**.

### [BulkSendTokens.xyz](https://bulksendtokens.xyz)

‚úÖ In this case, **both the proxy and implementation are verified**, which is how it should be:

## Why This Matters

When the implementation contract is unverified, users **can't see what logic is being executed**. That means:

- Hidden service fees could be added
- Backdoors might exist
- Logic could be changed at any time

If both contracts are verified, everything becomes transparent: you can inspect the code, see the upgrade logic, and ensure there's no malicious behavior.

## ‚úÖ Stay Safe

- Always check **both proxy and implementation** contracts are verified
- Don‚Äôt trust a verified proxy alone‚Äîit holds **no logic**
- Be cautious with tools that don‚Äôt verify everything

After struggling with existing wallets (like Rainbow, Rabby, etc.) to add features for my customers, I encountered hidden fees on swaps and bulk transactions, as well as poorly designed, non-typesafe JavaScript code — so I decided to build my own solution.

I created X-Wallet, an all-in-one Ethereum wallet built with TypeScript and Domain-Driven Design. It’s easy to use, simple to customize, and designed so well that even non-developers can understand the code.

X-Wallet is your go-to tool for airdrops, swaps, token management, and more!

## What is X-Wallet?

**X-Wallet** is an EVM-compatible wallet built for efficiency, scalability, and simplicity. Whether you're managing assets, swapping tokens, or sending airdrops in bulk, X-Wallet has you covered.

Built with **Expo** (on top of React Native) and following **domain-driven design principles**, it delivers a smooth and secure experience on both testnets and mainnets.
